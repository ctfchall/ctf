Questions:
1.What is the hidden message in these 2 videos?

Hint:
1.The hidden message is encrypted using AES-128 with encryption cipher mode CBC and having initialization vector (IV).
2.The password to reveal the hidden message is a combination of two phrases with some characters censored.
3.You might need to use a steganography tool that support mp3 and mp4 files to get the hidden message.
4.The secret key for encrypted text of AES-128 is seperated in 4 part using Shamir secret sharing scheme and required teamwork to get all part of message.
5.The directory with named "SecretKey" containing mp3 files with a message in every of it.
6.Combine the message you got in order to obtain secret key for AES-128 decryption.
